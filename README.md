# Project 2

## Concept

Our team wanted to create an app that would help reunite pets with their owners. My Buddy Finder would allow pet-owners to search a database for pets they have lost. It would also allow them to add their pet to the database.  
Additionally, persons who find pets can update the database with a photograph, description, and location for the animals they find. As pet-owners and people who are sympathetic to pet-owners who lose pets, we want to increase the rate at which pet-owners recover their lost pets.

## User Story

When I lose my pet, I will have a resource to help me find them.
